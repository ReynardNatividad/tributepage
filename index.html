                <li>In 2001, Musk conceived Mars Oasis, an idea to land a miniature experimental 
                    greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian 
                    regolith, in an attempt to reawaken public interest in space exploration.</li>
                <li>Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by
